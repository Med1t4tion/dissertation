It’s called Walthamstow Village because it was once exactly that, a village. Once the administrative heart of Walthamstow, the Village is now content to simply be the neon capital of Europe. An unlikely claim you might think, but visit God’s Own Junkyard on Ravenswood industrial estate and you’ll see what I mean. When your mind has been blown by the neon, pop in to Mother’s Ruin Gin Palace and Wildcard Brewery. All three businesses are based on Ravenswood, making it the most exciting industrial estate on the planet. The Village is full of quiet residential streets that all have easy access to bucket loads of pubs and restaurants. Take in the jazz at The Nags Head on Sunday afternoon, enjoy the excellent food and beer at The Queens Arms, and sample the legendary chicken and bacon jam burger at Eat17. To walk off all the food you’ve eaten, wander to the 15th century Ancient House, check out St Mary’s Church and its ivy clad church yard, have a pint in the garden at the Castle Pub, then admire the art in the windows of the old iron mongers.</p><h3 class=""listing-desc-header top""><strong>Dimensions:</strong></h3><h3 class=""listing-desc-header top""><strong>Entrance</strong></h3><p class=""top"">Via front door leading into:</p><h3 class=""listing-desc-header top""><strong>Entrance Hallway</strong></h3><p class=""top"">Staircase leading to first floor.
